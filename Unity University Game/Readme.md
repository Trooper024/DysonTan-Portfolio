# 👑 Crown Escape - Unity Game Project

## 🎮 About the Game  
**Crown Escape** is a short third-person exploration game created as part of a university Unity assessment. The objective is simple but mysterious:  
> Find the hidden **yellow crown** object, interact with it, and unveil a **secret door** leading into a bizarre maze-like area where your goal is to **escape**.

The game highlights Unity's **lighting** and **reflections** system, creating an eerie and immersive atmosphere as the player searches through the environment.  

## ⏳ Development Time  
This project was developed over a period of **2 weeks**.  
However, due to a **driver failure**, the original version of the game was **lost**. Despite the setback, I managed to **pull two all-nighters** and completely **rebuild the project from scratch** just in time for the class showcase the following day. It was a wild but rewarding sprint!

## 👀 Peer Review  
To ensure the gameplay and visuals hit the mark, I asked a classmate to playtest and review the game. Here were some of their thoughts:

> *“I really liked how the lighting was used to guide my attention subtly. The reflections added an eerie vibe to the environment—it made me feel like I was being watched”*
