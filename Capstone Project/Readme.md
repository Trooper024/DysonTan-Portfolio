# Redback Ops VR Game – Blender Contributions

Welcome to the Blender portfolio showcase for the Redback Ops VR project. This repository highlights my 3D design and development work as part of an internship team working on an immersive VR biking game.

## 🧠 About the Project

**Redback Ops** is a VR biking game where players explore a virtual world using a real bicycle controller. The goal is to provide an engaging and immersive experience through intuitive gameplay, vibrant environments, and interactive 3D assets.

## 🎨 My Blender Contributions

As a **Project Manager & Team Lead**, I took on both creative and leadership responsibilities from March 2023 to October 2024. My Blender work included:

- **Interactive Portal Design**  
  Created a 3D portal using Blender, integrated into the game for scene transitions. Enhanced immersion by combining animated effects with ray-casting for interaction.

- **Environmental Modeling**  
  Designed and modeled key in-game locations such as a **bike café** and **bike shop**, contributing to the game's world-building and visual storytelling.

- **Main Menu Redesign**  
  Reimagined the user interface space using 3D elements to make the main menu more intuitive and visually appealing.

## 👨‍🏫 Leadership & Mentorship

- Promoted to **Design Project Lead** in my second year, where I:
  - Shared advanced Blender and Unity workflows with the team.
  - Built a resource library with tutorials, tips, and best practices.
  - Provided 1-on-1 mentorship, helping new members onboard smoothly.
  - Encouraged collaborative development by setting weekly goals and offering constructive feedback.
